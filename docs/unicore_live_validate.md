# Archived Receiver Validation Note

> **Historical document (2026-06)** — describes the state at that time. Current reference: [`sensors/README.md`](../sensors/README.md).

This page is kept only to catch old links.

MowgliNext no longer ships a receiver-specific GNSS runtime wrapper. Direct GNSS installs now use Universal GNSS only, and the public install path is:

```bash
curl -sSL https://mowgli.garden/install.sh | bash
```

If you need receiver-specific live validation for a UM982, use tooling maintained outside this repository and do not treat it as a MowgliNext runtime dependency.
