# Layered mower assembly

The shared renderer is used by Hardware, Sensors and the map's URDF appearance.
It is a scaled illustration, not CAD or collision geometry.

- Configure the shell once in Hardware. Sensors and Map inherit the selection.
- Five shells: Rounded, Sculpted, Utility, Yardforce-inspired, RM1000-inspired.
- Style and transparency are display preferences saved in this browser.
- All top views face up; all side views face left. The separate red stop button
  is always at the rear, regardless of shell style or transparency.
- Transparent mode changes the opacity of the same shell art; it reveals the
  independent cutting-disc artwork/IMU. It never selects alternate artwork or different sizing.

## Geometry and anchors

Everything is expressed in metres in base_link: +X forward, +Y left, +Z up.
Top projection is (-Y,-X); side projection is (-X,-Z). The map anchors base_link
at the rear axle, not the shell centre. It projects the complete assembly plane
through the map camera, including bearing, heading, pitch and close-zoom perspective.

The parser reads visual sizes and origins from the processed robot description.
Settings previews overlay the edited API values (which already include model/
backend defaults). Chassis length, width, height and centre can therefore change
without stretching the wheels or sensors. Automatic caster/blade positions follow
mowgli.urdf.xacro. Hardware also exposes caster_x_offset (metres forward from
base_link; -1 preserves automatic placement). Explicit placement flows through
schema, settings, launch and xacro to both caster axles. It does not move other
sensors or change wheel control. Map URDF mode uses only the running description, never drafts.
A changed XML description is accepted; unsupported or malformed geometry clears
the assembled marker and allows the existing map fallback.

Supported layout is the standard Mowgli URDF: axis-aligned chassis box and named
wheel/caster/blade cylinders with direct base_link joints. Sensors use named
GPS/LiDAR/IMU box/cylinder visuals and direct joints. Other URDF layouts use the
existing map fallback rather than claiming guessed geometry is authoritative.

Source atlas bounds exclude transparent padding. A browser regression scans the
actual alpha pixels of all ten shell projections (outside the configured crop
as well) and requires their solid edges to match the crop exactly. The crop maps
to chassis width/length in top view and length/height in side view. Viewport
padding provides display space only; it cannot alter those physical extents. Caster artwork has a separate
tyre reference rectangle so its fork does not change the diameter or axle anchor.
Sensor art selects a visible local face and projects mounting roll/pitch/yaw.
The side of a vertical cylindrical LiDAR is yaw-invariant.

## Assets and maintenance

Shell atlases are in public/assets/robots/layered and registered in shellAssets.ts.
Component atlases (drive-wheel, caster, blade, gps, lidar, imu, dock) use partAssets.ts.
Each atlas contains top view on the left and side elevation on the right.
The stop button remains a small vector layer. The disc is a generated top/side
atlas; its cutting envelope, not the asymmetric image crop, sets its radius.

All images were generated with the built-in ImageGen tool. No source photos,
logos or brand text are shipped. The Yardforce shape was guided by the three
user-provided Classic 500/500B reference photos, then recoloured graphite/green.

Generation specification:
- Transparent alpha, complete isolated parts, no floor or external shadow.
- Matched orthographic top and side elevations, graphite grey and restrained
  mint-green highlights, no labels or branding.
- Shells contain no wheels, sensors or stop button; rear controls are closed panels.
- Drive wheel: tread from overhead, closed modern polymer hub in side elevation.
- Caster: modern low-profile polymer fork; true overhead pivot cap, tyre and fork.
- GPS: low rounded square graphite puck; LiDAR: short graphite cylinder;
  IMU: small green PCB with chip and mounting holes.
- Dock: curved existing generic-station silhouette; head at top/left, horizontal
  contact pins towards the parking tray. Nominal illustrative footprint 67 Ãƒâ€” 46 cm,
  height 15 cm; not a physical URDF/collision object. The saved dock pose anchors
  the parked rear axle, 10 cm ahead of the entry. Hardware supplies the paired
  dock automatically; the map has no independent dock appearance selector.
- Sensors have a thin mint silhouette highlight in the placement editor only.
- For replacements, remeasure visible pixel bounds and tyre reference bounds;
  do not compensate padding by changing the physical URDF dimensions.

## Verification

Unit tests cover parser rejection, edited vs live geometry, sensor rotations,
scale independence, identical solid/transparent assets and map projection.
Mocked Playwright checks cover all four styles, Hardware-only selection, mobile
navigation, sensor editing/dragging and actual Mapbox projection at multiple
zooms/headings/bearings/pitches. Screenshots are in screenshots.local/layered-mower.

These checks use the processed URDF fixture matching current template geometry
on upstream dev d4924a4b; no mower was moved, flashed or deployed for this work.

Latest artwork corrections (built-in ImageGen edits/generations):
- Caster: narrow true overhead tread and small pivot cap; rolling direction +X.
  The top sprite is rotated 180 degrees to put the pivot ahead of the tyre axle,
  matching the side view. Its tyre reference maintains URDF diameter and width.
- Rear wheel: closed graphite aero hub, five recessed panels, subtle mint arc.
- Blade: round graphite disc, three silver pivot blades, separate side elevation.
- Dock: retained reference proportions after reviewing shorter/longer variants;
  head rotated to top in plan and a horizontal contact pin in side elevation.
  Atlas clips omit external padding. No source bitmap is edited by Python.

ROS validation: non-root Docker xacro tests exercise automatic, positive, zero
and negative caster positions. GUI schema/template/default-type parity tests
run in a non-root Go container. This feature has not been deployed to .118.

## Chassis vertical placement

`chassis_z_offset` places the bottom of the shell relative to the rear axle.
The YardForce 500/500B starting value is **-0.050 m**, estimated from the supplied
Classic 500/500B photos, not measured. With the configured 0.100 m wheel radius
and 0.190 m body height, this puts the bottom 0.050 m and top 0.240 m above ground.
The value is editable in Hardware Ã¢â€ â€™ Chassis & Geometry, mirrored in the schema
and passed through launch to both URDF body visual/collision origins. It does
not move base_link, wheels, casters, blade or sensor frames and does not change
the 2D navigation footprint. Other populated mower presets explicitly retain
zero offset; custom/sparse configurations inherit the template unless overridden.

The live map uses the running URDF. Hardware/Sensors previews show edited values;
save and restart ROS before the running model reflects a changed offset.
Changing body height preserves the configured bottom position.

Physical validation: **HARDWARE_REQUIRED** for the photo-estimated value.
Baseline: codex/layered-mower with chassis_z_offset=-0.050, YardForce500/B preset,
wheel_radius=0.100, chassis_height=0.190. No firmware or robot was accessed.
Procedure: on the intended Yardforce unit, powered off on a level surface with
blades removed, measure ground to the lowest body skirt and highest shell point.
Compare against 50 mm and 240 mm; a discrepancy over 5 mm rejects this provisional
fit and calls for adjusting the offset and/or body height to the measurements.
These measurements are not a prerequisite to using this illustrative preview.

## Preset review and mobile map budget (2026-10-10)

The Hardware preview follows the model picker; it no longer includes the dock.
Wheel layers precede the shell in both views, so the opaque body hides the upper
wheel while transparent mode reveals the same wheel at exactly the same axle.
Height is the physical visible shell height, excluding image margins. With body
height H and bottom offset O: axle-relative bottom = O, top = O + H, centre =
O + H/2. Ground clearance adds the drive wheel radius. The Yardforce preset uses
H=190 mm, O=-50 mm, radius=100 mm: bottom=50 mm, top=240 mm above ground.
Its rear track is 325 mm centre-to-centre (365 mm outer tyre width), inside the
450 mm body box. We do not alter drive geometry just to make an image look wider.
The automatic rear-to-front-caster axle distance is 450 mm for that preset.

The full application preset gallery actually selects YardForce500B, SA650,
LUV1000RI, Sabo, and RM1000 through Hardware controls, independently on desktop
and mobile. The legacy SA650/900ECO/LUV1000RI/Sabo presets still have 44.75 mm
wheel radius, an unverified inherited value documented in mowerModels.ts;
those very small rendered wheels faithfully expose that preset limitation.
RM1000 has no geometry defaults and retains existing values (Sabo in this
ordered gallery); it is NOT evidence for RM1000 physical dimensions.

### Compact map artwork

Only map markers use `public/assets/robots/layered/map/*-*.webp`; settings use
the original PNG atlases. Source crop/reference rectangles remain authoritative.
The derivative image is placed back into that exact pixel-coordinate rectangle,
so reduced resolution changes neither the physical chassis edges nor axle,
sensor, caster or blade anchors. Both opacity modes share the same derivatives.
Generate after any source image or crop-metadata change, from gui/web:

```sh
node --experimental-strip-types scripts/generate-map-artwork.mjs
```

This deterministic crop/resize/WebP pipeline uses the existing pinned Playwright
Chromium (install it with `npx playwright install chromium` if absent). Originals
are never overwritten. Body/dock longest edge: 384 px; blade: 256 px; wheels and
sensors: 128 px. WebP quality 0.85, preserved alpha. All 24 derivatives total
223,862 bytes. No runtime image processing or new runtime dependency is added.

Memoized assembly content is reused between poses, geometry bounds are memoized,
and identical map projection updates preserve state. No sensor glow is enabled
on the map. Opaque map mode omits concealed blade/IMU assets. Existing map display
budgets remain 20/10/5 Hz for Visual/Balanced/Efficient. URDF XML is only parsed
when the description changes, never for each pose.

Production Chromium check: 390x844 viewport, 4x CPU throttle, local plain Mapbox
basemap, mocked 20 Hz pose/status, Efficient mode, three-second sample. The
Yardforce plus dock initial artwork is **50,536 bytes**, down from 6,608,981 bytes
(99.2% less); 40 SVG descendants, zero artwork DOM mutations during movement.
Median and p95 animation frame interval were about 16.7 ms. These are desktop
browser emulation results, not a physical-phone or live satellite-map benchmark.
Screenshots/JSON in screenshots.local/layered-mower include the full app chrome;
all telemetry is fixture data and no mower was contacted. Full source imagery
is retained for the larger settings previews.

Verification: TypeScript/production build; 27 focused unit tests; 12 application
Playwright cases including all four styles, five preset selections, mobile,
height/offset/track, sensors and map; map projection fixture checks physical
corners under zoom, heading, bearing and pitch. Map tests reject PNG requests,
images above 384 px, and initial artwork transfers above 150 kB. Regeneration
and hardware physical measurements remain distinct from this rendering evidence.

## Wheel enclosure audit (2026-10-10)

Rendering baseline: d94ea7f4, YardForce500/B preset, full and compact assets.
No robot, firmware, receiver or installed config was read for this audit.
Historical source comparisons:

- 5acb6f78 (initial ROS2, 2026-03-26): approximate 400 mm body width,
  350 mm centre track and 50 mm tyre width.
- cb134cb9 (2026-04-07): actual xacro arguments 400 mm body width,
  325 mm centre track, 40 mm tyre width. Its header says 400 mm track,
  but that is contradicted by the executable argument; not an old 400 mm track.
- 78a0a015 (2026-09-05): template/presets changed body width to 450 mm
  after a maintainer measurement on their Yardforce500. This does not establish
  dimensions on .118. Wheel track/width stayed 325/40 mm.
- Current template describes wheel_track as "from OpenMower"; the inspected
  history does not establish a physical Yardforce track/tyre-width measurement.

Source-alpha inspection at the drive axle (top atlas row 683, x=0 in robot
coordinates) gives a 551 px shell span within the 629 px body crop. At 450 mm
body width, that is about 394 mm of body at the axle versus 365 mm outer tyre
span. Thus the current opaque shell covers the wheel centres and outer edges
at that row, even with correct crop scaling and track/width arithmetic.

The supplied Yardforce overhead and rear-quarter photos visibly have narrower
rear bodywork and pronounced wheel recesses. Our generated top shell is too
full around that region, and its side panel lacks the real wheel opening.
This is a visual fidelity defect; correct crop bounds do not validate shell
contours. Correct the shell recesses while retaining the configured outer body
extent and axle anchors. Do not enlarge drive track merely to expose wheels.

HARDWARE_REQUIRED for selecting different physical track/tyre-width defaults.
Baseline to record at measurement: intended unit (.118 if applicable), installed
mower model/config and wheel type; renderer comparison remains d94ea7f4 with
325 mm track, 40 mm width, 450 mm maximum body width. On a level surface with
power off and blades removed, measure both tyre widths, their outer-to-outer
span and body width at the rear axle (also maximum body width). Calculate
centre track as outer span minus half the sum of the two tyre widths. Agreement
within 5 mm supports the current values; a larger discrepancy rejects them for
that unit and calls for a measured override. Perspective photos alone cannot
settle those absolute measurements. No parameter or artwork was changed by
this audit.


## Review regression fixes

Sensor drag and yaw handles keep separate 48 CSS-pixel hit targets when the
model is fitted to the editor, including narrow mobile layouts and large custom
chassis. A ResizeObserver converts those screen dimensions into SVG coordinates.
The regression test drags the LiDAR centre on a 1.2 m chassis without changing
yaw, then rotates it without changing position.

Sensor geometry retains its joint mounting point separately from its local
visual origin. Settings edit the mount/rotation; the preview recomputes the
rotated visual offset, matching the processed URDF used by the map. Unchanged
settings, combined mounting rotations and repeated previews have regression
coverage. Input fallbacks use joint coordinates rather than artwork centres.

Validation: 29 focused unit tests, 15 settings/map browser tests and three PR
gallery captures pass; TypeScript, focused lint (zero errors) and production
build pass. Sensor-editor screenshots refreshed after these changes.

## Hardware appearance pairs

Hardware presets may declare `appearance: {style: "yardforce", dockAppearance: "styled"}`
in `constants/mowerModels.ts`. Applying a confirmed hardware preset selects both
visual defaults; presets without a pair use the sculpted chassis and styled dock.
Appearance metadata is separate from numerical `defaults` and is never sent to
ROS. The 500/500B supply the Yardforce-inspired shell; RM1000 supplies its own
layered shell. They currently share the illustrative styled dock, whose shape
was already inspired by the RM1000 station. Neither choice measures a robot.

The pair is stored with the existing browser-local visual preference. Existing
preferences that only contain a shell style acquire the styled dock default.
Hardware, Sensors and Map use the same preference. Changing the body style picks
its registered hardware pair (or the generic styled dock); transparency remains
independent. A confirmed model change applies that model's explicit pair.

The map has one link to Hardware instead of independent mower/dock selectors.
Old `gui.map.dock.appearance` settings no longer override the pair. Saved RM1000
map choices seed the new RM1000 assembly when no explicit shell preference exists;
existing RM1000 hardware installations likewise seed that style. The retired
static generic mower becomes the shared assembly. No migration writes ROS config.

Future dock artwork belongs in `DOCK_APPEARANCES`; a model can pair its ID with a
chassis style. Photo docks use the existing calibrated MapImageMarker; a new
assembled dock needs a renderer branch alongside StyledDockMarker. Old photo
assets remain as contributed source/reference material, not selectable mower
renderers. The obsolete static generic mower WebP is no longer shipped.

### RM1000 artwork provenance

`rm1000.png` was generated with the built-in imagegen tool from the contributed
RM1000 overhead photograph plus `sculpted.png` as a style reference. Its approved
top view is unchanged. The side now uses `rm1000-side.png`, generated from the
user-supplied RM1000 side photograph (clipboard ff774aba-79d3-44f9-95be-269d297f4027).
It follows the stepped front skirt, raised console and large rear wheel opening,
restyled in graphite/mint. Wheels, sensors and the rear stop remain separate layers.
This is a photo-informed illustration, not CAD or new physical measurements.

The exact generation and projection-correction prompts are in
`rm1000-artwork-prompt.md`. Both committed sources have a 1774 Ã— 887 canvas;
`SHELLS.files.side` selects the separate side source without modifying the top.
Alpha >220 bounds are [73,48,624,804] for top and [44,162,1702,622] for side.
Both solid and transparent modes use the same bounds. The compact map top WebP
is also unchanged; the side derivative is regenerated by the existing pipeline.
No RM1000 physical defaults have been invented; its geometry preset remains empty
and existing/custom dimensions drive the renderer.

### Rear console button placement

The red stop button is an independent SVG layer. `SHELLS.stop.fromFront` anchors
it within the visible chassis length (front=0, rear=1), shared by both projections.
`roofFromTop` seats its side silhouette on that shell's local roof. Anchors are
artwork metadata and never shift the real wheels, sensors, or safety controls.
The RM1000 screenshot fixtures align the chassis wheel arch to the rear axle;
production wheel placement continues to come only from configured/running geometry.
