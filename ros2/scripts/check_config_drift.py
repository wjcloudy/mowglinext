"""check_config_drift.py — detect divergence between mowgli_robot.yaml copies.

Background
----------
The repo carries (at least) two mowgli_robot.yaml files:

  ros2/src/mowgli_bringup/config/mowgli_robot.yaml  — committed template
  install/config/mowgli/mowgli_robot.yaml           — runtime (mounted into
                                                       the production container,
                                                       managed by the GUI)

The installed file is SPARSE (Architecture Invariant 15): it holds only
install-time choices + calibration outputs, and `load_robot_params`
(mowgli_bringup/launch/robot_config_util.py) deep-merges it OVER the
template so any absent key inherits its template default. STRUCTURAL
fields (chassis dimensions, wheel kinematics, sensor mounts) normally
live ONLY in the template; a structural field that also appears in the
installed file with a DIFFERENT value gives Nav2 the wrong footprint, the
URDF the wrong sensor offsets, etc. That kind of inconsistency is
invisible at runtime and bites at the worst moment — during a coverage
path, the inflation may not match the chassis the robot is actually
presenting to the world.

What this script does
---------------------
- Loads both files.
- For each STRUCTURAL field, flags DRIFT only when the field is present in
  BOTH files with differing values. A structural field that lives only in
  the template (absent from the sparse installed file) is the EXPECTED,
  healthy state and is NOT flagged.
- Flags a structural field present in the installed file but with NO
  template default — it breaks GUI "reset to default" and the
  propagate-a-new-default property (Invariant 15).
- For each USER_OVERRIDE / calibration-output field, expects them to
  differ (or only exist in the installed file) and is silent.
- Flags ANY field present in the installed file whose value EQUALS the
  template default (issue #381). Such a key is a no-op at merge time, but
  it masks future template-default changes (Invariant 15's propagate-a-
  new-default property) — the fix is to delete the line, not to keep it in
  sync. Calibration outputs and install-time seed keys (INSTALL_SEED) are
  exempt: the committed sparse file deliberately carries those as
  placeholders for the installer / GUI / calibration to fill in.
- Prints a diff and exits non-zero on any of the above.

User-tunable fields (datum, dock pose, IMU mounting calibration, GNSS
transport, NTRIP creds…) and calibration outputs (ticks_per_meter, wheel
PID gains, magnetometer) are intentionally allowed to differ / live only
in the installed file.

Run as part of CI; or manually before / after editing either yaml.
