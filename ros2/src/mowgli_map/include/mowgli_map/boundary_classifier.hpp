// Pure geofence blade-kill classifier, factored out of
// MapServerNode::check_boundary_violation so it is unit-testable without ROS
// (see progress_tracker.cpp and test_boundary_classifier.cpp). Firmware has
// no polygon knowledge — this classification is the ONLY geofence
// enforcement in the system, so its two margins are deliberately asymmetric:
// "soft" (still recoverable, debounced against single-tick TF noise) vs
// "lethal" (blade/motor hazard — stop immediately, never debounced).

// `consecutive_outside_samples` is the caller-owned debounce counter — reset
// to 0 the moment the robot is back inside or within the soft margin, and
// incremented (saturating) on every soft-outside sample. `soft` only
// asserts once the counter reaches `debounce_samples`; `lethal` asserts
// immediately off the same sample — deliberately not debounced, because a
// robot that is genuinely `lethal_margin_m` outside needs the blade to stop
// *now*, not after N more samples.
