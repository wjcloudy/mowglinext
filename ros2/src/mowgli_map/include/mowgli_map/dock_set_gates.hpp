 * @file dock_set_gates.hpp
 * @brief Which gates a SetDockingPoint request must pass — pure, no ROS deps.
 *
 * `map_server_node`'s `~/set_docking_point` serves four different kinds of
 * write, and they do NOT need the same protection:
 *
 *   POSITION_CAPTURE  use_gps_position=true. X/Y is averaged from the raw GPS
 *                     antenna samples NOW, so the robot MUST be seated on the
 *                     dock (is_charging) or the average is a position
 *                     somewhere on the lawn. All gates apply.
 *   MANUAL            no position flag set. The operator typed / dragged the
 *                     pose. All gates apply, exactly as before this header.
 *   PENDING_ANTENNA_MOTION
 *                     use_pending_antenna=true, yaw_source=MOTION. The normal
 *                     dock-calibration write: X/Y from the raw antenna mean
 *                     that `~/capture_dock_antenna` took ON the dock (THAT
 *                     call ran the charging + RTK + sample-count gates, at the
 *                     one moment "on the dock" and "RTK-Fixed" are both
 *                     guaranteed), lever-arm-corrected with the fresh MOTION
 *                     yaw and written together with it. The yaw only exists
 *                     once the robot has reversed ~1.5 m OFF the dock, so the
 *                     charging gate cannot apply to THIS call; the position's
 *                     on-dock guarantee is the pending capture itself, which
 *                     must exist, be unexpired and unconsumed.
 *   YAW_ONLY_MOTION   preserve_position=true, yaw_source=MOTION. The fallback
 *                     when no capture is pending: write the motion yaw, keep
 *                     the stored X/Y. Same off-dock situation — requiring
 *                     is_charging here made the calibration fail
 *                     deterministically (field-diagnosed 2026-09-17).
 *
 * Extracted so the decision is unit-testable without spinning a node, and so
 * the charging exemption cannot silently widen: it is reachable through TWO
 * exact field combinations and nothing else, and neither lets a caller supply
 * a position that was measured off the dock.

/**
 * @brief Classify a request and return the gates it must pass.
 *
 * The two off-dock MOTION kinds drop exactly two gates, each for a stated
 * reason:
 *   - charging: the yaw is motion-derived, the robot is necessarily off the
 *     dock (see file comment).
 *   - fused-yaw convergence: that gate protects writes that READ the fused
 *     yaw (or a position lever-arm-corrected with it). A MOTION yaw is the
 *     COG circular mean of the reverse leg, validated by the calibration
 *     node's own gate (min samples, sigma ceiling, bearing match, baseline
 *     displacement); the fused yaw is neither written nor consulted, and right
 *     after the drive it is still settling (~6 deg window-std observed), so
 *     the gate could only ever produce false rejections here.
 * They KEEP the GPS-accuracy gate: the MOTION contract is "RTK-gated", and
 * live RTK quality at write time is the only part of that claim map_server
 * can check for itself.
 *
 * Every other combination keeps every gate — in particular nothing that
 * captures a position NOW, or takes one from the caller, is ever exempt from
 * the charging gate.
