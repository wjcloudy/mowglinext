 * @file dock_antenna_capture.hpp
 * @brief Raw-antenna dock position capture — pure math + validity, no ROS deps.
 *
 * A dock POSITION may only ever come from the RAW GPS antenna position
 * (/gps/fix projected with the datum). While the robot charges, fusion_graph
 * gauge-resets the fused pose onto the STORED dock pose, and /gps/absolute_pose
 * / /gps/pose_cov are lever-arm-corrected with that pinned yaw — anything
 * derived from them on the dock is circular and just re-saves the old value.
 *
 * The antenna is NOT the robot: base_footprint sits one lever arm behind it
 * along the chassis heading. The heading is only measurable by driving OFF the
 * dock, the antenna-on-the-dock only while seated ON it. So the two halves are
 * taken at different moments and joined here:
 *
 *   1. on the dock, charging, RTK-Fixed  -> PendingAntennaCapture (mean ENU,
 *      yaw-free, held in map_server memory, never persisted, expires);
 *   2. off the dock, fresh motion yaw    -> DockBaseFromAntenna(capture, yaw)
 *      gives the base_footprint dock position, written together with the yaw.
