// Pure RTK wrong-fix motion-consistency gate, factored out of OnGnss so it is
// unit-testable without ROS/GTSAM (see fusion_graph_node_callbacks_a.cpp).
// F9P can re-solve the carrier-phase ambiguity on a different integer set
// after a brief signal drop (vegetation, multipath spike) and the new
// solution jumps by a few cm while still reporting a trustworthy status +
// sub-cm covariance. The gate rejects a GPS step that is larger than the
// chassis could plausibly have travelled since the last fix (wheel arc +
// lever-arm sweep during rotation) plus a fixed slack budget.
//
// CRITICAL DESIGN NOTE — bounded vs. runaway: the two accumulators
// (wheel_dist_m, abs_dtheta_rad) MUST be reset after every fix, whether it is
// ACCEPTED or REJECTED. This is what keeps the gate's budget bounded to "at
// most one inter-fix interval of travel". The reverted GnssMobileGate
// (bundled into PR #307) instead reset its equivalent accumulator only on
// ACCEPT: once it started rejecting, the accumulator never cleared, motion
// kept piling up against a stale reference, "expected motion" ran away
// (observed 20.9 m for <1 m of real travel), and every subsequent fix
// rejected forever (GPS locked out, cov_xx ballooned to ~2.5 m σ). See
// CLAUDE.md "What NOT to Do" for the incident writeup.
