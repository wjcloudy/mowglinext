  // encoders measure ground-contact distance, which holds on dry
  // surfaces but breaks down on wet grass and during low-speed pivot
  // attempts where both drive wheels slip in the same direction. The
  // chassis IMU sees the whole truth — angular velocity directly, no
  // wheel-traction assumption — so a wheel-vs-gyro disagreement is
  // ground truth that the wheel readings are not trustworthy this
  // tick. Field-observed 2026-05-27: during a stuck dock-rotate
  // attempt the wheels reported a steady ~0.1 m/s forward velocity
  // and ~0.3 rad/s rotation, while the gyro saw <0.02 rad/s — the
  // wheel translation slid the map-frame estimate by 0.6 m in 6 s
  // even though the chassis hadn't moved, and the controller chased
  // the drift with more commanded motion, fueling the slip.
  //
  // Rule: when |dtheta_wheel - dtheta_gyro| is large enough that the
  // wheel-reported rotation can't be explained by gyro noise, zero
  // out the BetweenFactor's translation. The pose still advances in
  // yaw (from the gyro), and any GPS / scan-matching unary will pull
  // (x,y) in the right direction; without the veto the wheel
  // integration carries the pose along the phantom slip path
  // unopposed. The slip_sigma_xy floor keeps sigma_x/sigma_y tight
  // enough that GPS still anchors the estimate when available, but
  // not so loose that one tick of slip can shove the pose by tens of
  // centimetres.
  //
  // Threshold is gated by both the disagreement magnitude AND a
  // minimum gyro stillness — otherwise the slip detector would fire
  // every time the gyro updates faster than the wheel encoders, which
  // happens on every normal turn. The combination "wheels rotating
  // hard, gyro near zero" is the genuine slip signature.

  // Evaluated over a sliding WINDOW of nodes, not on this node alone

  // 2026-09-02 it fired 1.33/s on STRAIGHT swaths (wheel 0.00 vs gyro
  // 0.05 rad/s at the increments) and zeroed ~5 % of nodes' translation

  // window sums the deltas and scales the thresholds by its node count,
  // so sustained slip (~0.15 rad over 0.5 s) trips it while jitter
  // averages to ~0. The veto is still APPLIED per node — this node's

  // create, not of how far the robot actually drove. Measured 2026-08-24 on
  // RTK-Fixed: the published major-axis σ read p50 0.574 m / max 1.391 m
  // while the GNSS receiver reported 0.014 m and FTC's cross-track error was
  // 0.008-0.016 m. At node_period_s = 0.04 and 0.2 m/s each hop covers 8 mm
  // yet the old fixed σ_x claimed 50-92 mm for it (~10x the step), so the
  // marginal on the newest node grew as σ·√N — 0.092·√40 = 0.58 m for the
  // ~40 hops between the last GNSS-anchored node and the head, matching the
  // observation. It was also cadence-dependent: the same physical motion
  // accumulated √2.5x more uncertainty at 25 Hz than at 10 Hz.
  //
  // Fix: make VARIANCE (not sigma) proportional to the distance the step
  // covered — σ = k·√d, Var = k²·d — so N hops of d/N metres sum to exactly
  // the variance of one hop of d metres. That is cadence-invariant by
  // construction, and is the noise-model counterpart of the tick_scale
  // applied to the per-tick GATES above (same reasoning: a quantity tuned
  // per-tick must be rescaled when the tick length changes). Sigma-
  // proportional scaling (σ = k·d, as the issue sketched) would have been
  // wrong in the opposite direction: it accumulates as k·d/√N, i.e. tighter
  // the faster you tick. Precedent for the √ form is a few lines below —
  // the gyro-bias random walk already uses σ = σ_rw·√dt.
  //
  // The noise distance uses the RAW accumulator, not the slip-vetoed

  // random walk, they model a wheel FAULT — a measurement that is wrong in a
  // way unrelated to how far the encoders say we went — and their job is to
  // RELEASE the X constraint so GPS / scan-matching set XY.
  //
  // Scaling them per-distance would defeat them precisely in the case they
  // exist for. During a pivot the encoders report ~0.8 mm of phantom
  // translation per tick at 25 Hz, so a per-distance pivot sigma would
  // collapse to ~1.4 mm and pin the pose to the phantom motion — the exact
  // 0.2-0.4 m per-spin drift pivot_wheel_sigma_x was added to stop. Likewise
  // the adaptive term is driven by a yaw residual measuring rotation the
  // wheels invented; the linear error that implies is not bounded by the
  // (often vetoed, hence zero) reported step.
  //
  // Because these fire only on a detected fault, keeping them per-node does
  // not reintroduce the √N growth in normal driving: net_residual is 0 and
