// Blade intent re-assert. Pure logic, no ROS, so it is unit-testable standalone
// (see test_blade_reassert.cpp) — same shape as blade_gate.hpp.
//
// ── The failure this exists for ─────────────────────────────────────────────
// CMD_BLADE is sent ONCE per MowerControl service call; nothing repeats it.
// Since firmware 1fd01ae9 (2026-09-25) the STM32 accepts a blade ON only when a
// CMD_VEL arrived within its 200 ms watchdog window, and treats a stale ON as an
// OFF that also clears its retained request. FollowStrip sends its ON right
// BEFORE dispatching the coverage goal (after a 1.5 s spin-up wait with no
// controller publishing), so that ON is stale by construction: the firmware
// drops it silently, the bridge keeps mow_enabled = true, HighLevelStatus keeps
// saying MOWING, and the robot drives the swath with the blade stopped (field
// log 2026-10-04 12:33:40, first mow on firmware v1.12.21).
//
// ── What it does ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// When the host's intent is ON but the firmware REPORTS the blade stopped, the
// ON is sent again — only at a moment the firmware can accept it.
//
// ── NOT A SAFETY BYPASS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The STM32 firmware stays the sole blade safety authority: a re-assert is the
// same fire-and-forget request as the original, and the firmware still refuses
// it under an emergency, in IDLE, or while a motor-link re-arm is required. The
// host-side conditions below only stop the bridge from ASKING when it must not:
//   * never across an emergency — the firmware deliberately forgets the blade
//     request there so that clearing the emergency cannot restart the blade
//     (#763). `intent_authorized` is dropped on any emergency and only an
//     explicit MowerControl ON sets it again;
//   * never while the lift handling owns the blade (`enable_allowed`);
//   * never on a stale CMD_VEL: the firmware would read that ON as an OFF, so a
//     blind periodic re-send would STOP a blade that is running.
