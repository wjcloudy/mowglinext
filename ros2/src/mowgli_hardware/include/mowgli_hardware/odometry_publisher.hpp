 * @file odometry_publisher.hpp
 * @brief Node-owned helper: turns STM32 LlOdometry wire packets into
 *        ~/wheel_ticks (per-packet diagnostics) and ~/wheel_odom
 *        (aggregated, ~20 Hz) publishes.
 *
 * Extracted from hardware_bridge_node's former handle_odometry() as part of
 * the god-node breakup (2616-line TU, see CLAUDE.md task board #11).
 * Behavior-preserving: the packet-handling logic below is a verbatim port —
 * see the .cpp for the detailed rationale comments (16-bit encoder-wrap
 * recovery, tick-spike rejection, 50 ms aggregation window, dock-charging
 * force-zero + covariance policy).
