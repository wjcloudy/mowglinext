// PathProgressGoalChecker — a Nav2 GoalChecker plugin that fires only
// when the robot has traversed at least `progress_threshold` of the
// FTC path's poses, AND is near the final pose.
//
// Why: SimpleGoalChecker fires whenever the robot is within
// `xy_goal_tolerance` of the goal pose, REGARDLESS of how much of the
// path was actually traversed. F2C coverage paths can route the robot
// through the perimeter and end with a pose that happens to sit near
// the perimeter too — the goal-checker then fires during the headland
// phase, completing the action with <2% coverage.
//
// PathProgressGoalChecker gates completion on two conditions:
//   1. monotonically-tracked max-reached path index >= progress_threshold
//      * global_plan size (default 0.95 = 95%)
//   2. robot is within xy_goal_tolerance of the goal pose AND yaw is
//      within yaw_goal_tolerance (matches SimpleGoalChecker semantics
//      for the final-pose check)
//
// The plugin subscribes to the FTC controller's republished
// `<plugin_name>/global_plan` topic so it always has the latest path
// for index-tracking. Resets the max-reached index on a new path,
// detected by pose-count change OR the front pose moving more than 2 m.
// header.stamp is intentionally ignored — it is unreliable when
// controller_server forwards a stale plan and would defeat the
// republish-tolerance that keeps the index monotonic across per-tick
// republishes.
