// PathProgressGoalChecker — a Nav2 GoalChecker plugin that fires only
// when the robot has traversed at least `progress_threshold` of the
// FTC path's poses, AND is near the final pose.
//
// Why: SimpleGoalChecker fires whenever the robot is within
// `xy_goal_tolerance` of the goal pose, REGARDLESS of how much of the
// path was actually traversed. F2C coverage paths can route the robot
// through the perimeter and end with a pose that happens to sit near
// the perimeter too — the goal-checker then fires during the headland
// phase, completing the action with <2% coverage.
//
// PathProgressGoalChecker gates completion on two conditions:
//   1. the robot has PROGRESSED along the path, i.e. EITHER
//      a. monotonically-tracked max-reached path index >= progress_threshold
//         * global_plan size (default 0.95 = 95%), OR
//      b. the path length still ahead of the furthest monotonically-reached
//         point is <= xy_goal_tolerance ("driven to within the goal
//         tolerance of the END").
//   2. robot is within xy_goal_tolerance of the goal pose AND yaw is
//      within yaw_goal_tolerance (matches SimpleGoalChecker semantics
//      for the final-pose check)
//
// Why 1b: FTC parks up to max_goal_distance_error (0.50 m, the floor of
// xy_goal_tolerance) short of the last pose and then emits zero velocity. On a
// long path that is < 5 % of the poses, so 1a passes; on a 0.6 m sub-path it is
// most of the path, 1a never passes and controller_server's progress checker
// aborts the goal 30 s later (field 2026-09-21: 2 of 6 sub-paths). 1b accepts
// exactly what 2 already accepts at the end of ANY path, measured along the
// path so it cannot be met by a robot that is merely NEAR the end — at the
// start of a looped path whose end is near its start, the whole path is still
// ahead. A path whose total length is itself <= xy_goal_tolerance lies
// entirely inside the goal tolerance and completes on proximity, as the
// short_path_poses paths already do.
//
// The plugin subscribes to the FTC controller's republished
// `<plugin_name>/global_plan` topic so it always has the latest path
// for index-tracking. Resets the max-reached index on a new path,
// detected by pose-count change OR the front pose moving more than 2 m.
// header.stamp is intentionally ignored — it is unreliable when
// controller_server forwards a stale plan and would defeat the
// republish-tolerance that keeps the index monotonic across per-tick
// republishes.
