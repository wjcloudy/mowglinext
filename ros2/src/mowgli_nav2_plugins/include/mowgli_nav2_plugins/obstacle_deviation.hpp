/// skirt the robot OUT of the zone (zone boundary = lethal in the global
/// keepout costmap) is rejected. The guard applies ONLY to the offset
/// checks (chooseDeviationSide / growDeviationUntilClear's non-zero
/// deviation), never to the nominal-path or findFirstObstacle checks.
///
/// The affine maps the OFFSET-sample frame into this boundary costmap's
/// frame, e.g. boundary_frame (map) <- offset_frame:
///   bx = tx + cos_yaw * x - sin_yaw * y

///
/// CONFINEMENT IS ITS ONLY ROLE. Between 2026-09-02 and 2026-09-17 the same
/// struct was also handed to the DETECTION helpers as a `zone_mask` (issue
/// #517), where a lethal LOCAL cell that was ALSO lethal here counted as NO
/// obstacle at all. That subtraction is REMOVED: `keepout_filter` stamps every
/// drawn map obstacle lethal in the global costmap, so "the map knows about
/// this tree" was used to erase "the LiDAR can see this tree", and FTC drove
/// into the same mapped tree twice on 2026-09-16 (it logged "AVOIDANCE
/// complete (path clear for 3.7s), back on path" nine seconds before the
/// first hit, with the trunk's lethal cells plainly in the local costmap).
