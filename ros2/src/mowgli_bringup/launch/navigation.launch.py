navigation.launch.py

Navigation stack launch file for the Mowgli robot mower.

Brings up:
  1. Localization — fusion_graph_node (GTSAM iSAM2 factor graph) owns
     both map→odom AND odom→base_footprint. Map-frame inputs: wheel +
     IMU + GPS + COG (+ optional LiDAR scan-matching and loop-closure).
     Local-frame: wheel vx + gyro_z integrated at IMU rate (replaces
     the standalone robot_localization ekf_odom_node).
  2. Two helper nodes — cog_to_imu (GPS COG as a continuous absolute-
     yaw observation with adaptive covariance) and mag_yaw_publisher
     (tilt-compensated LIS3MDL magnetometer yaw, gated on
     /ros2_ws/maps/mag_calibration.yaml existing).
  3. Nav2 bringup — full navigation stack (controllers, planners,
     recoveries, BT navigator, costmaps, lifecycle).

Architecture (REP-105):
  map → odom → base_footprint → base_link → sensors
  fusion_graph_node owns both map→odom AND odom→base_footprint.
  It runs WITHOUT LiDAR when use_scan_matching=false AND
  use_loop_closure=false — the graph is then just a Pose2 backbone
  with wheel between-factors, gyro between-factors, and GNSS
  lever-arm + COG / mag unaries; local-frame DR is still produced
  from the same wheel + gyro stream.
  ekf_map_node, ekf_odom_node, slam_toolbox, Kinematic-ICP, and
  FusionCore have all been removed — see CLAUDE.md "What NOT to Do"
  for deprecated paths.
