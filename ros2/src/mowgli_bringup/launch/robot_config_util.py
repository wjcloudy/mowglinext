# Shared robot-config loader for the MowgliNext launch files.
#
# The INSTALLED mowgli_robot.yaml (at /ros2_ws/config/mowgli_robot.yaml) is
# SPARSE: it holds only what is decided at install time or calibrated per site
# (datum, NTRIP credentials, dock pose, hardware selections, calibration
# paths). Every other parameter's DEFAULT lives in the in-package template
# config/mowgli_robot.yaml, which is versioned and ships with the software.
#
# load_robot_params() DEEP-MERGES the installed sparse config OVER the package
# template, so:
#   * defaults come from the template — a maintainer bumping a default
#     propagates to every robot whose installed config does not override it;
#   * a key ABSENT from the installed config falls through to the template
#     default — this is exactly how the GUI's "reset to default" works
#     (it deletes the key from the installed file);
#   * an install/site decision or an explicit GUI override still wins.
#
# Nodes therefore always receive a COMPLETE parameter set, exactly as before
# the split — only the on-disk installed file is now allowed to be sparse.
# Older FULL installed configs keep working unchanged (every key overrides its
# identical template default; a no-op merge).

# is what caused the 54% coverage regression (see CLAUDE.md Invariant 6).
# The LIVE default in normal operation is still mowgli_bringup/config/

# and hardware_bridge_node's wheel_track default — the firmware does the
# differential-drive IK (left = vx - wz*track/2) with ITS copy, so a host value
# that disagrees makes every derived turn geometry a lie.

# LiDAR presence: mowgli_robot.yaml ONLY (no LIDAR_ENABLED env var)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# `lidar_enabled` in the robot config is the ONE source of truth for whether
# the LiDAR-dependent half of the stack comes up. The `LIDAR_ENABLED`
# environment variable is NOT consulted any more (removed 2026-08-31): it used
# to be a "fallback when the yaml is silent", and on a live robot that fallback
# was exactly the failure mode --- an installed config with no `lidar_enabled`
# key plus a stale `docker/.env` saying `LIDAR_ENABLED=false` ran the whole
# stack GPS-only while the operator toggled LiDAR on in the GUI and saw nothing
# change. An ambient env var is not an operator decision; a CLI/compose
# `use_lidar:=` override still wins, because typing it is one.
#
# `LIDAR_ENABLED` legitimately survives in `docker/.env` for what it always
# really controlled: whether the `mowgli-lidar` CONTAINER is started. The two
# can now disagree in the other direction (config on, container absent), which
# is why scan_deskew_node warns when `use_lidar` is true and no scan ever
# arrives (see mowgli_localization/src/scan_deskew_node.cpp).

LIDAR_ENABLED_KEY = "lidar_enabled"

# Launch args and .env values are text; these are the tokens that read as true.
TRUE_TOKENS = ("true", "1", "yes", "on")

# Absent-key default: LiDAR OFF.
#
# `lidar_enabled` is an INSTALL-DECIDED key (Invariant 15) that is deliberately
# ABSENT from the in-package template, so --- unlike every other parameter ---
# it has no template default to fall through to and its absence carries
# meaning: no LiDAR was ever recorded for this robot. Three reasons that
# resolves to False rather than the historical True:
#
#   1. A robot whose config never mentions a LiDAR most likely has none. The
#      installer always writes the key (install/lib/config.sh) and the shipped
#      sparse seed carries it, so absence means the installer never ran ---
#      a hand-rolled docker-compose, which is precisely the no-LiDAR-hardware
#      case.
#   2. The failure modes are asymmetric. Wrongly OFF gives the fully coherent,
#      supported GPS-only stack (nav2_params_no_lidar.yaml, pass-through
#      collision_monitor, no scan factors) --- degraded but consistent. Wrongly
#      ON gives the broken half-state: an obstacle_layer with no observation
#      source, a scan-based collision_monitor with a dead source, and
#      fusion_graph subscribing to a topic nothing publishes while reporting
#      success-shaped scan-matching diagnostics.
#   3. It must equal the GUI's JSON-schema default (gui/asserts/
#      mower_config.schema.json), because the settings backend PRUNES any key
#      whose value equals its schema default (sparsifyFlat, Invariant 15). With
#      the schema default True, an operator switching LiDAR ON writes `true`,
#      the backend prunes it as "same as default", the key vanishes, and the
#      toggle is inert in the ON direction forever. False makes the ON write a
#      genuine override that persists --- and it already matches what the GUI
#      renders for an absent key (`values.lidar_enabled ?? false`).
