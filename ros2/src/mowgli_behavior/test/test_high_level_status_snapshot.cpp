/**
 * @file test_high_level_status_snapshot.cpp
 * @brief Regression test for the frozen GUI battery gauge while charging.
 *
 * PublishHighLevelStatus is a SyncActionNode that only fires on tree
 * transitions, and behavior_tree_node's 1 Hz timer used to re-publish the
 * cached message VERBATIM. Once the tree parked in the low-battery charge hold
 * (BatteryGuardHandler: PublishHighLevelStatus "CHARGING" once, then a 30 s
 * RetryUntilSuccessful loop with no further transitions), the topic kept
 * emitting the battery percent captured at the moment of docking — observed on
 * the robot 2026-08-23 frozen at 46.03 % for the whole charge while the pack
 * actually climbed from 25.84 V to 26.42 V. The same staleness hit the mowing
 * progress during a multi-minute FollowStrip.
 *
 * withLiveStatusFields refreshes every context-derived field from the live
 * BTContext while keeping the tree-owned main state identity (state /
 * state_name) from the cached snapshot. Live TRANSIT and SCAN_PAUSED overlays
 * are the sub_state_name exceptions. These tests pin that split with a plain
 * BTContext (no ROS, no publisher).
