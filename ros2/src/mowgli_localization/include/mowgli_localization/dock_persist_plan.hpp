//
// Pure (ROS-free) description of HOW the dock calibration persists its result
// through map_server — the requests it sends, and the verdict + operator text
// for each way the sequence can end.
//
// The two halves of a dock pose are only measurable in two different places:
//
//   POSITION  the RAW GPS antenna, averaged while the robot is SEATED on the
//             dock, charging and RTK-Fixed. The routine starts in exactly that
//             state (it waits for RTK-Fixed on the dock before it moves), so
//             the antenna is captured THERE — map_server's
//             ~/capture_dock_antenna — and held in map_server's memory.
//   YAW       measured by REVERSING OFF the dock, so it exists when the robot
//             is ~1.5 m away from the charger.
//
// They are joined in ONE write after the reverse leg (DockPoseStep): map_server
// lever-arm-corrects the pending antenna with the fresh yaw and stores x, y and
// yaw together. If no capture is pending, the yaw alone is written and the
// stored position kept (DockYawStep).
//
// History, so the two earlier orderings are not re-tried:
//   - persist everything AFTER the verified re-dock: docking_server only reads
//     dock_pose at container startup, so the same-session re-dock steers on
//     the OLD pose and proves nothing about the new one; gating on it only
//     discarded good measurements (94f01b38).
//   - yaw off the dock, position after the re-dock (first version of this
//     header): circular. A wrong stored POSITION makes the re-dock stop short
//     of the contacts, the robot never charges, and the position capture that
//     would have fixed it is never reached (field test 2026-09-17: 0.35 m
//     short, three "timed out waiting for charge"; and when pushed onto the
//     contacts by hand the receiver sat at RTK-Float under the dock, 0 usable
//     samples). The re-dock is therefore a pure CONFIRMATION pass now: nothing
//     is measured or saved after it.

 * @brief Verdict once the persistence and the confirmation re-dock are over.
 *
 * SUCCESS means "the dock pose — yaw AND position — is saved". That is the
 * calibration's product. Whether the confirmation re-dock reached the charger
 * is reported, loudly, but does not decide success: inside this run the
 * docking stack still steers on the OLD pose (loaded at startup), so with a
 * wrong old position it stops short of the contacts BY CONSTRUCTION — calling
 * that a calibration failure told the operator to retry a calibration that had
 * worked, and could never converge. retry_reason stays NO_CHARGE_ON_REDOCK on
 * such a success so the GUI can render it as a warning, and the message says
 * first and unambiguously that the robot is NOT on the dock.
 *
 * YAW_ONLY is reported as a failure (position was not updated — the operator
 * should run it again), with the yaw explicitly listed as saved.
