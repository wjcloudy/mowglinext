/**
 * @file navsat_to_absolute_pose_node.hpp
 * @brief Converts sensor_msgs/NavSatFix → mowgli_interfaces/AbsolutePose.
 *
 * Bridges generic ROS2 GNSS fixes into the Mowgli AbsolutePose message.
 *
 * Performs WGS84 → local ENU projection using a configurable datum origin.
 * Universal GNSS is the single owner of the typed /gps/status contract. This
 * node consumes /gps/fix for coordinates/covariance and /gps/status for the
 * authoritative RTK/fix state, then publishes /gps/absolute_pose plus the
 * robot_localization-friendly /gps/pose_cov twin.
 *
 * /gps/pose_cov additionally requires a GENUINELY NEW receiver observation.
 * The adapter republishes its last accepted fix on a timer with the receipt
 * stamp unchanged, so callbacks keep arriving after the receiver freezes.
 * /gps/absolute_pose still mirrors every delivery (it carries its own stamp
 * and flags), but the pose_cov twin is consumed as an absolute anchor — see
 * the freshness gate in on_navsat_fix.
 *
 * Subscribed topics:
 *   /gps/fix     sensor_msgs/msg/NavSatFix
 *   /gps/status  mowgli_interfaces/msg/GnssStatus
 *
 * Published topics:
 *   /gps/absolute_pose    mowgli_interfaces/msg/AbsolutePose
 *   /gps/pose_cov         geometry_msgs/msg/PoseWithCovarianceStamped
