Kinematic drivetrain plugin for the Webots Mowgli sim.

Phase 2.2 of the Webots migration (Gazebo→Webots port).

PROBLEM
-------
ODE wheel-floor friction does not faithfully reproduce a 0.10 m/s
diff-drive command on this PROTO geometry. After exhaustive tuning of
mass, damping, friction, COM, and motor torque (see the file header in
``protos/MowgliMower.proto`` for the full list of failed knobs), the
chassis still pitches ~13° forward at static equilibrium and only ~10 %
of the commanded velocity reaches the body (~90 % wheel-floor slip).

SOLUTION
--------
We do not care about realistic wheel slip in this simulator — we care
about Nav2 + BT + FTC controller logic working end-to-end so we can
iterate on coverage strips, obstacle deviation, and dock approach.

This plugin replaces the wheel-friction-coupled body motion with a
**fully kinematic** one. Each Webots timestep, the plugin:

  1. Reads the latest ``/cmd_vel`` (TwistStamped) from twist_mux (or a
     manual ``ros2 topic pub`` in Phase 1 testing).
  2. Integrates the diff-drive kinematics forward by the timestep:
        new_yaw = yaw + ω·Δt
        new_x   = x + vx·cos(yaw + 0.5·ω·Δt)·Δt
        new_y   = y + vx·sin(yaw + 0.5·ω·Δt)·Δt
  3. Teleports the Robot to ``(new_x, new_y, current_z)`` via the
     ``translation`` field and to ``(0,0,1, new_yaw)`` via the
     ``rotation`` field. Webots honours these field writes
     instantaneously, so the body's pose is exactly what we compute.
  4. The diff_drive_controller (a ros2_control plugin instantiated by
     webots_ros2_control alongside this plugin) continues to drive the
     wheel motors with velocity setpoints derived from the same
     ``/cmd_vel``. This is what keeps the wheel ``PositionSensor``
     outputs realistic and therefore /joint_states → /wheel_odom_raw →
     ekf_odom_node → odom→base_footprint TF all advancing — which Nav2
     pose-tracking behaviors (BackUp, DriveOnHeading, Spin) read for
     their success/timeout checks. We deliberately do NOT touch the
     wheel motors from this plugin, see the long comment in init() and
     step() for why.

EVOLUTION
---------
Two earlier revisions failed in instructive ways:

  * Revision 1 used ``Supervisor.setVelocity()`` instead of field-set.
    It improved cmd_vel honesty from ~10 % → ~70 % (Phase 1 test:
    ``ds=0.36 m`` over 5 s vs 0.50 m expected) but did NOT fix the
    chassis pitch (still 13°), because ``setVelocity`` only sets the
    velocity *vector* — gravity and wheel-friction normal forces still
    act on the body during ODE integration. The velocity also gets
    degraded between ticks by the next physics step.

  * Revision 2 used field-set teleport + per-step ``resetPhysics()``.
    cmd_vel honesty hit 95 % and pitch dropped to 0°, but
    ``resetPhysics()`` recursively zeroes the children's ODE state,
    including the wheel HingeJoint angular velocities. This silently
    overwrote the diff_drive_controller's motor setpoints back to
    zero every tick — wheels never spun, /joint_states reported 0,
    /wheel_odom_raw integrated to 0, and Nav2's BackUp/DriveOnHeading
    timed out thinking the robot had not moved.

The current revision (3) drops per-step ``resetPhysics()``. The
init-time call clears any settling impulses from the world load; from
then on the field-set teleport is sufficient. ODE may briefly try to
infer "infinite velocity" between teleports but the wheel constraints
+ chassis static friction dampen those impulses to a level that does
not visibly affect the body pose, while the wheels are now free to
spin under the diff_drive_controller's commands.

TRADEOFFS
---------
+ cmd_vel response is exact (acceptance tests #1–#3 pass at ≥95 %).
+ Chassis pitch stays effectively at 0° throughout (typically <0.1°).
+ Nav2's costmap, FTC controller, BT undock/coverage logic all see a
  robot that goes where they tell it (Phase 2: BackUp 1 m completes,
  GetNextUnmowedArea + FollowStrip dispatch reached).
+ /wheel_odom_raw is honest, so ekf_odom_node + the rest of the
  localisation chain receive realistic dead-reckoning.
- The simulator no longer reproduces wheel-floor slip events.
  Acceptable: the production wheel-slip detector (sim_wheel_slip.py)
  injects synthetic slip into the wheel-odom stream before EKF fusion,
  so slip behaviour is testable through that channel.
- Collisions with static obstacles are detected by Webots' collision
  detection on the chassis bounding box, but because we teleport every
  step the body will pass straight through. This is OK in the current
  sim — Nav2's collision_monitor + costmap are responsible for
  stopping before collisions, so collision *response* itself is not
  under test. (Future: gate the teleport on contact-points read.)

PLUGIN PROTOCOL
---------------
The class implements the contract documented in
``webots_ros2_driver``'s ``PluginInterface``:
  * ``init(webots_node, properties)`` — called once when the driver
    boots. ``webots_node.robot`` is the Webots ``Robot``/``Supervisor``
    instance.
  * ``step()`` — called on every Webots timestep (via the driver's main
    loop, after ``robot.step()``). Use this to spin rclpy + apply the
    per-step kinematic update. The driver itself calls ``robot.step()``
    so we must NOT call it here.

        Runs the (cmd_vx, cmd_wz) twist through the same wheel-level

        body twist for this sim step.

        The pipeline (mirroring firmware/.../cpp_main.cpp::on_cmd_vel +
        motors_handler):

          1. Differential-drive kinematics:
               left_target  = cmd_vx − cmd_wz · WHEEL_SEPARATION / 2
               right_target = cmd_vx + cmd_wz · WHEEL_SEPARATION / 2

          2. Saturate each side to ±FIRMWARE_MAX_MPS.

          3. Reset the PI integrator on direction reversal /
             stop-to-go / target=0 transitions so wind-up doesn't
             drive the wheel backwards as it decelerates.

          4. PI loop in PWM space (Kp · err + integrator clamped to
             ±FIRMWARE_PI_INT_MAX_PWM). Output PWM =
             feedforward (target · PWM_PER_MPS) + Kp · err + ∫.

          5. Saturate effective PWM to ±FIRMWARE_PWM_MAX.

          6. Static / kinetic deadband: a stalled wheel needs
             |PWM| ≥ FIRMWARE_DEADBAND_PWM_STATIC to break free;
             a moving wheel keeps rolling down to
             FIRMWARE_DEADBAND_PWM_KINETIC. Below either threshold
             the wheel reports zero velocity, exactly like the real
             motor + PAC5210.

          7. Force PWM = 0 when target=0 AND |actual| < hold
             threshold — avoids the residual integral hum on a
             stopped wheel.

        #
        # WHY THIS IS LOAD-BEARING (gravity / lidar):
        # without zeroing the z component, ODE accumulates a downward
        # velocity from gravity between teleports. The teleport rewrites
        # the position back to z=z₀ but does NOT reset the velocity, so
        # the next ODE substep starts from a non-zero downward velocity
        # and integrates the chassis (with the lidar rigidly attached)
        # below z=0 BEFORE the next teleport runs. Sensors (Lidar in
        # particular) sample after the physics step but before the
        # plugin teleport, so they see the chassis at whatever sunken Z
        # position ODE last computed. After a few hundred ticks the
        # implied terminal velocity is large enough that the lidar
        # samples from BELOW the floor, which makes every ray clip
        # against the underside of the floor and return +inf — that is
        # the “/scan all-inf” bug Phase 2.2 ran into.
        #
        # WHY THIS IS LOAD-BEARING (sensor angular velocity):
        # the InertialUnit + Gyro + Accelerometer trio reports the
        # rigid body's ODE velocity, not the field-set teleport rate.
        # If we set the linear+angular velocity here to match the
        # commanded (vx, ω), the gyro reads the correct ω, the IMU's
        # angular_velocity matches reality, and ekf_map_node fuses a
        # consistent rotation rate. Without this — i.e. previously
        # zeroing all 6 DOF — the gyro reported 0 ω even while the
        # field-set teleport rotated the chassis, the EKF concluded the
        # robot was static, and FTC's PRE_ROTATE PID never saw the
        # heading error close → 10 s goal_timeout fired on every
        # FollowStrip dispatch.
        #
        # `Supervisor.setVelocity()` operates only on THIS Solid's ODE
        # state; it does NOT recurse into children. So unlike
        # resetPhysics() (which would also zero the wheel HingeJoint
        # angular velocities and silently kill the diff_drive_controller's
        # motor commands — see the long comment further down), this is
        # safe to call every step. The wheels keep spinning under the
        # controller's setpoints; the chassis just gets a coherent
        # rigid-body velocity for sensor sampling.

        # We deliberately do NOT call resetPhysics() here every step.
        #
        # resetPhysics() recursively zeroes the internal ODE solver
        # state for this node AND ALL ITS CHILDREN, which means the
        # wheel HingeJoint angular velocities also get zeroed every
        # tick. Combined with the field-set teleport (which forces
        # the parent's pose), the wheels physically cannot rotate:
        # the diff_drive_controller's motor.setVelocity() command is
        # silently overwritten back to zero by our resetPhysics. The
        # downstream effect is /joint_states reporting position=0
        # forever, /wheel_odom_raw integrating to zero, the EKF
        # dead-reckoning chain (odom→base_footprint via ekf_odom_node)
        # frozen, and Nav2's pose-tracking behaviors (BackUp,
        # DriveOnHeading) thinking the robot never moves.
        #
        # Without resetPhysics() the field-set teleport is still
        # honoured by Webots; ODE may briefly try to compute residual
        # impulses from the implied "infinite velocity" between
        # teleports, but those are dampened by the wheel HingeJoint
        # constraints and the chassis static friction enough that the
        # body settles to the kinematic pose we set, while the wheels
        # are free to spin under the diff_drive_controller's commands.
        # We rely on the init-time resetPhysics() to clear any startup
        # impulses; from then on the field-set is sufficient.

        # ── Wheel cosmetic rotation ────────────────────────────────────
        # We deliberately do NOT call motor.setVelocity() here — the
        # diff_drive_controller (instantiated by ros2_control via
        # webots_ros2_control) is already writing wheel velocity
        # setpoints derived from the same /cmd_vel we just consumed,
        # using the same wheel_separation / wheel_radius values from
        # config_webots/ros2_control.yaml. Letting the controller own
        # the motor commands has two important consequences:
        #
        #   1. The Webots PositionSensor on each HingeJoint accumulates
        #      a realistic wheel position, which the joint_state_-
        #      broadcaster publishes on /joint_states. RSP then animates
        #      the wheel TFs; diff_drive_controller integrates them
        #      into /wheel_odom_raw; and ekf_odom_node fuses that into
        #      odom→base_footprint. *This is what Nav2's behaviors
        #      (BackUp, DriveOnHeading, Spin) read for their pose-
        #      tracking success/timeout checks.* Skipping this would
        #      freeze the odom frame and break every Nav2 motion goal.
        #
        #   2. We avoid a writer-vs-writer race on the motor velocity
        #      setpoint. Even though both writes would compute the same
        #      omega from the same cmd_vel + same diff-drive math,
        #      having a single owner per Webots device is the cleaner
        #      contract.
