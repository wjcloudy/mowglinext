 * @brief What "on the dock" means on OpenMower v1 electronics.
 *
 * MowgliNext's Status.is_charging means ON THE DOCK (charger contacts live):
 * it gates the zero-odometry rule (Invariant 11), the BT's charging state, the
 * docking current (Invariant 12) and the at-rest IMU calibration.
 *
 * The LowLevel status bit 2 (STATUS_BIT_CHARGING) cannot carry that meaning.
 * In the v1 firmware it is `charging_allowed`, the charge RELAY, and it is
 * wrong in opposite directions on the two firmware generations in the field:
 *
 *   situation              v0.13.x firmware        current v1-fw branch
 *   mowing, off the dock   1  (checkShouldCharge   0
 *                             is true at 0 V)
 *   docked, charging       1                       1
 *   docked, battery full   0  (relay cut off)      0  (relay cut off)
 *
 * (OpenMower Firmware/LowLevel/src/main.cpp, updateChargingEnabled /
 * checkShouldCharge, at tag v0.13.2 and on branch v1-fw.) Trusting the bit
 * would zero /wheel_odom in the middle of the lawn on old firmware, and report
 * an undocked robot while it sits on a full-battery dock on both.
 *
 * OpenMower's own high level never used the bit for this either: mower_logic
 * sets is_charging = charge_voltage > 10.0 V. The voltage at the charging
 * contacts is present exactly when the robot is on a powered dock, whatever
 * the relay is doing, so that is the signal used here. Pure, no ROS.
