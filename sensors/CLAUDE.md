# sensors/ — working notes for Claude

Three LiDAR driver wrappers (`lidar-ldlidar/`, `lidar-rplidar/`, `lidar-stl27l/`) run **beside** `mowgli-ros2` as self-contained Docker images and talk to it only over DDS. **The GNSS sidecar image (`gps/Dockerfile`, `gps/start_gps.sh`) is no longer what ships** (2026-09-19, commit `bfd44f1a`, "#625"): the deployed `gps` container now runs an EXTERNAL prebuilt image (`${UNIVERSAL_GNSS_IMAGE}`, `ghcr.io/pepeuch/universal-gnss-ros2-lyrical`) that reads `mowgli_robot.yaml` directly via an inline launcher in `install/compose/docker-compose.gps.yml`; `gps/Dockerfile` and `gps/start_gps.sh` remain in the tree but are no longer built, pushed, or composed by anything. The only ROS node this tree still owns and ships is `gps/mowgli_gnss_bridge`, which is compiled straight into the `mowgli-ros2` image (`ros2/Dockerfile:415`), NOT into a `sensors/gps` sidecar image. Everything else here is a vendored upstream LiDAR driver plus a startup shell script.
It must NOT own: which containers run, device paths, udev symlinks, `docker/.env` or the compose fragments (installer — see `install/CLAUDE.md`); the `GnssStatus.msg` schema (`ros2/src/mowgli_interfaces`); or any consumer of `/gps/*` and `/scan` (see `ros2/CLAUDE.md`). Nothing here publishes TF or a pose — root CLAUDE.md Invariants 1–2.

## Build · test · run

```bash
# GPS sidecar Dockerfile — ORPHANED, not what ships (see above). Building it
# locally still works (build context MUST be the repo root — it copies
# ros2/src/**) but the result is not what install/compose/docker-compose.gps.yml
# composes; that runs UNIVERSAL_GNSS_IMAGE instead.
git submodule update --init --recursive ros2/src/external/universal-gnss
docker build -t mowgli-gps -f sensors/gps/Dockerfile .

# LiDAR images — context is the sensor directory
docker build -t mowgli-lidar-ldlidar --target runtime sensors/lidar-ldlidar/
docker build -t mowgli-lidar-stl27l  --target runtime sensors/lidar-stl27l/
docker build -t mowgli-lidar-rplidar sensors/lidar-rplidar/     # CI passes no target

# Cheap host-side checks (all that runs off-robot)
bash -n sensors/gps/start_gps.sh
python3 -m py_compile sensors/gps/universal_gnss_topic_bridge.py

# Resolver dry-run against the ORPHANED start_gps.sh (built locally, above —
# the deployed mowgli-gps container runs UNIVERSAL_GNSS_IMAGE and has no
# start_gps.sh inside it at all): prints the receiver_node / bridge / ntrip_node
# commands, launches nothing. In-container only — it needs the
# /opt/gnss_sidecar overlay (start_gps.sh:395-404) and exits 1 when the
# resolved serial device is absent (L459).
docker exec -e GNSS_DRY_RUN=true mowgli-gps /start_gps.sh

```

`mowgli_gnss_bridge`'s tests run in the **`Test mowgli_gnss_bridge` job of `sensors-gps.yml`** — and nowhere else. The image itself still builds with `-DBUILD_TESTING=OFF` and deletes `/ws/build`, and `ros2-ci.yml` only builds `ros2/src`, so that job is the sole thing that compiles and executes them. It assembles the same source set as the Dockerfile's builder stage, then runs `colcon test --packages-select mowgli_gnss_bridge`, and finally asserts the gtest XML reports a non-zero case count — because a package whose tests silently stop being registered would otherwise turn the job green with zero coverage, which is exactly how these tests rotted unnoticed until 2026-09-05. **Keep that job's package list in lockstep with the Dockerfile's builder stage.** To reproduce locally, build a scratch overlay containing `mowgli_interfaces`, `ros2/src/external/universal-gnss/gnss_ros2` (`universal_gnss_ros2`) and this package: `colcon build --packages-up-to mowgli_gnss_bridge && colcon test --packages-select mowgli_gnss_bridge`.

CI: one thin caller per LiDAR image (`.github/workflows/sensors-{lidar-ldlidar,lidar-rplidar,lidar-stl27l}.yml`) → reusable `_sensor-docker.yml` (amd64 + arm64, push-by-digest then manifest merge). **`sensors-gps.yml` is the one exception**: since `bfd44f1a` (2026-09-19) its `build:` job (which used to call `_sensor-docker.yml` and run an in-image smoke test) was deleted entirely — it now has only the `test:` job described above, because the GNSS sidecar ships as an external image and there is nothing of this tree's to build/push for it.

## Conventions

- **This package is uncrustify-styled, NOT clang-format-styled — do not clang-format it.** It sits outside `ros2/src/`, so the repo's formatter never sees it: `ros2/scripts/format.sh` globs `ros2/src/` only, `.githooks/pre-push` amends `ros2/src/` only, and a parent-dir lookup from `sensors/` never finds `ros2/.clang-format`. Because clang-format has never run here, the code follows **ament's uncrustify profile** instead, and `ament_uncrustify` is left ENABLED in the package's `CMakeLists.txt` (unlike every `ros2/src` package, which mutes it) so that stays true. Running clang-format over it would restyle ~180 lines of working code and then fail that linter. Format with `ament_uncrustify --reformat` from the package directory — easiest inside `ros:lyrical-ros-base` with `ros-lyrical-ament-uncrustify` installed. `ament_copyright` IS muted, for the usual reason: the project declares licensing with an SPDX identifier, which ament does not recognise. `cpplint` is also enabled — mind its 100-column limit.
- Node conventions in [`.claude/rules/ros2.md`](../.claude/rules/ros2.md) apply to `mowgli_gnss_bridge`: declare every param in the constructor, explicit QoS (status/diagnostics reliable depth 10, RTCM depth 50 — `universal_gnss_topic_bridge.cpp:291–292`).
- **Two bridge implementations must stay behaviour-identical**: C++ by default, `GNSS_BRIDGE_IMPL=python` falls back to `universal_gnss_topic_bridge.py` with identical `--ros-args` (`start_gps.sh:529–545`). A projection change lands in C++ **and** Python **and** the gtest.
- Shell: `set -euo pipefail`; config resolution is always **YAML → env → built-in default**, never the reverse.
- Dockerfiles pin upstream drivers by ref/SHA (`LDLIDAR_REF` / `LDLIDAR_SHA`) and patch them with `sed` **inside the Dockerfile**. Never vendor a patched upstream source tree into this repo.
- Fixed public contract: `/gps/fix` (NavSatFix), `/gps/status` (`mowgli_interfaces/GnssStatus`), `/rtcm` (`rtcm_msgs/Message`), `/diagnostics`, `/scan` (LaserScan). GNSS `frame_id: gps_link`, LiDAR `frame_id: lidar_link`.

## Component-specific gotchas

- **gps build context = repo root.** `sensors/gps/Dockerfile:37–46` copies `ros2/src/mowgli_interfaces` + seven universal-gnss packages; `docker build sensors/gps/` fails. CI passes `context: .` with `dockerfile: sensors/gps/Dockerfile`.
- **universal-gnss is a submodule on the mowglinext FORK**, branch `main` (`.gitmodules`). Both issue #395 fixes (GLONASS-1230 optional-for-RTK correction health, UM980 `MODE ROVER UAV` default) are now upstream in that fork's main, so the old stacked `fix/rover-dynamic-mode-uav` branch is gone. A bump means re-pinning the gitlink, not just editing the branch line; with the submodule uninitialised the Dockerfile's seven `COPY`s have nothing to copy and the build fails.
- **`install/compose/docker-compose.gps.yml` no longer passes any `GNSS_*` env vars at all** (removed by `bfd44f1a`, 2026-09-19): the `gps` service runs the external `UNIVERSAL_GNSS_IMAGE` via an inline Python `command:` block that reads `/config/mowgli_robot.yaml` directly — there is no env passthrough left to mask. (The note below about `start_gps.sh`'s own YAML→env→default resolution still describes that ORPHANED script correctly, in isolation — it just no longer runs in the deployed container.)
- **`parse_yaml` is grep+sed, not a YAML parser** (`start_gps.sh:25–35`): it takes the FIRST indented `key:` anywhere in the file, regardless of which node's block it belongs to, and strips exactly one quote pair. Its `|| true` is load-bearing under `set -e` — remove it and a missing key aborts the container before the fallbacks apply.
- **The receiver-profile apply must finish and release the port** before `receiver_node` opens it (`start_gps.sh:469–512`) — only one process can hold the serial device. Its failure is deliberately non-fatal (a pre-configured receiver still runs); do not make it fatal.
- **NTRIP `centipede/centipede` fallback fires only for caster `crtk.net`** (`start_gps.sh:177–215`), mirrored in `install/lib/env.sh` — keep both in sync. Never commit a real `GNSS_NTRIP_PASSWORD` into config, docs or logs.
- `/gps/status` and `/rtcm` are the **public mirrors**; the real receiver↔NTRIP path is the private `/_gps_internal/universal/{status,rtcm}` (`start_gps.sh:417–418`). Do not point consumers at the internal names.
- **`GNSS_STACK=disabled` is rejected by the sidecar itself** (`start_gps.sh:389`) — "no GNSS" is expressed by not composing the container at all, in `install/lib/compose.sh`.
- **ldlidar ignores `LIDAR_PORT` / `LIDAR_BAUD`**: `/dev/lidar` @ 230400 is hardcoded in `ldlidar.yaml:6–7`. Only the rplidar/stl27l fragments pass those through as `command:` overrides.
- **`lidar.bins: 455` is deliberate** (`ldlidar.yaml:15–19`): the upstream `ldlidar_stl_ros2` driver jitters 499–503 readings per revolution, and `bins` forces a fixed-length resample. Don't "tidy" it away.
- **The ldlidar image carries three mandatory build patches** (`lidar-ldlidar/Dockerfile:56–92`): FATAL_ERROR→WARNING for the humble/jazzy distro gate, `count_subscribers(_scanTopic)` → `_scanPub->get_subscription_count()` (the relative-name lookup always returns 0, so the driver reports NO SUBSCRIBERS and publishes nothing), and an explicit `libldlidar.so` copy (upstream never installs it, and the runtime stage copies only `/ros2_ws/install`).
- **`LIDAR_ENABLED` in `.env` only decides whether the container is composed.** The ROS-side LiDAR mode is `mowgli_robot.yaml:lidar_enabled` (root Invariant 15, `docs/claude/parameters.md`) — starting this container does not enable scan-matching or the LiDAR Nav2 overlay.
- **Both prose docs here are partly stale**: `sensors/README.md` points at a sensors/lidar/ directory and a `docker.yml` workflow that no longer exist; `wiki/Sensors.md` still describes `GNSS_STACK=legacy`, the sensors/unicore/ and sensors/nmea/ trees and `mowgli_bringup/universal_gnss.launch.py` — all removed. Prefer `docs/claude/codemaps/deploy.md`, and fix the doc rather than coding to it.
- **Images are multi-arch (amd64 + arm64)**; the robot is arm64. Anything arch-specific (a prebuilt `.so`, an x86 binary, a `--platform` pin) breaks only the arm64 leg — i.e. only the real robot. `rplidar`'s caller sets no `target:` while ldlidar/stl27l pin `target: runtime`; copy the right caller shape when adding a sensor.

## Safety

These containers do not command motion, but they feed the two signals that gate it: `/scan` (collision_monitor + FTC obstacle deviation) and the GNSS fix behind `/gps/status` and the fused pose (BT localization gating, and the dig detector's stand-down — root Invariant 16). A silently dead or wrongly-framed publisher here reads downstream as "clear ahead" or "position is fine". Treat topic-contract, `frame_id`, QoS and driver-pin changes as safety-relevant in PR reviews (root CLAUDE.md § *Safety*), and never add a software e-stop or blade path here — the firmware is the sole blade/e-stop authority.
